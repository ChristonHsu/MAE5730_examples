# Matt's example code for MAE 4780/5780 - Intermediate Dynamics
Various dynamics and MATLAB examples made while TAing for Andy Ruina's intermediate dynamics.

My conventions for files typically are:

* MAIN - usually the file that starts everything
* RHS - a function which can by integrated with ODE45
* derive/deriver - A script which derives equations of motion (usually) auto-writes a MATLAB function.

### Lectures 1 & 2
Examples include:
* Euler integration
* Using ODE45
* Event detection in MATLAB's ode solvers (bouncing ball example)
* Symbolic toolbox (solving arm kinematics example)
* Best practices for animation (interpolating in time, change plot object data)

### 3 Body problem
Three masses attracted by gravity. Includes:
* Derivation script
* Animation and plotting of solutions
* FSOLVE root finding to look for periodic solutions given an initial guess
* A file containing ~15 periodic solutions I found that can be played back.

### Handout problem 14
4 masses on a plate, some moving, some not. Find plate motion for 0 angular momentum.
Full problem statement is inside the folder. Includes:
* Derivation script
* Animation
